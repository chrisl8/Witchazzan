# License

## Source code

- The **source code** is licensed under the [AGPLv3](https://opensource.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0) license.
    - This applies to all content of this codebase, except for any folder with a different license within it, and/or any file with a different license called out within it, or any files included here from third parties, such as those listed in the Attributions section of README.md.

## Artwork and Story
- All images and text files are Copyright 2023 - Christen Lofland, and may not be redistributed nor included in your own applications for distribution.
    - This specifically pertains to the contents of the `/lore` folder and the `/assets` folder and their sub-folders.
    - This does **not** apply to incidental text within source code files that are under AGPLv3 license.
    - You are, of course, free to fork this repository and all of its content, and to clone it to your computer systems, but you may not redistribute the parts that are not under the AGPLv3 license.

## License Files

- To make this clear, each top level folder has a `LICENSE.md` file in int. If in doubt, look for that file in the top level of the folder structure that you are in. That file determins the license for the file(s) in question.

## Redistribution

- The only locations permitted to distribute the artwork and story portions of this repository are this repository itself and the game's website at https://witchazzan.space/.

## Digital Preservation Exception

- If at some point in the future, the site https://witchazzan.space/ is no longer registered and/or someone else registers it but does not run this game from it, and if the repository owner no longer runs this game from any site, making it impossible to play this game publicly online, then I grant permission to serve this game, in whole, without modification other than to fix bugs, on your own servers.

## Intent

The intent of this license scheme is that you are free to use this code to create and even distribute your own game, with the following exceptions:
- You must generate your own artwork and story content.
- You must also make your source code open source (Copyleft), but not your artwork or story content.
- You may not simply copy this entire game and run it from your own server.

If this license is a problem for you, please contact me, or create an issue on the repository, explaining what it is that you are wanting to do that this license prevents you from doing.
