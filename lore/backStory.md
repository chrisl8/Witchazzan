## A small hadron cooperator

Millions, perhaps billions, of years ago, we lived simple corporeal lives together on a small planet. Over time our existence changed. It went from organic to fantastic. This existence that we created for ourselves allowed us to survive the millennia and thrive together as one society.

Then something unexpected happen, our Universe fractured in a mysterious way. Every sentient life form suddenly found themselves isolated from one another, each in their own "copy" of the Universe. Each copy was not only identical, but natural changes in one copy existed in all others. However each of us was stuck, isolated, unable to either affect the physical universe in any way nor to interact with each other's Universes.

It was never clear what the cause was or, as we started to ponder the nature of our Universe more deeply, even what it was that had been broken. Was this just always how it was, but we somehow didn't know it? Was this an unintended consequence of something we had done long ago? Or was this always the fate of our Universe?

We found that we had one power left in this Universe. The ability to generate and send out Hadrons. Hadrons are a sort of "particle" that, in the right environment, can generate reality. Hadrons can also travel between Universes.

Having lived together for so long, we all had similar knowledge, and each of us, in time, whether decades or centuries, discovered this power and how to use it. We could only use Hadrons to generate reality in our own individual Universe, but we could send them out, and others could receive them and essentially replicate their affect in their own Universe.

This created a way to "project" ourselves to each other, and to project tings into our own Universe and then share them to others as well.

In order to recreate a semblance of our former vast society, we used our power to create a system for simulating a shared experience. In one place, we built the Small Hadron Cooperator.

This system was able to receive, sort, filter, transmit, broadcast and even archive Hadrons. By all joining this system, we could once gain live our lives together, even though we always knew that in reality, we were apart.
