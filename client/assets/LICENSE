Note that within this folder and its sub-folders, there do exist files which are not mine. These files may be licensed under different terms. Each of these files is called out in or referenced in the README.md file in the root of this repository.

Note that this assets folder is contained WITHIN the client folder for technical and convenience reasons. In a perfect world it would reside elsewhere, making it more obvious that its contents are not licensed in the same way as the rest of the contents of the client folder. However, the fact that the parent folder, and its contents, are licensed under a different license does not affect this folder's license.
